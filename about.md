Well, glad you asked!

## `vexcodes.com`

Just the domain itself: this small info site about myself and a few blog posts.

This part of the site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and uses the [Dark Poole theme](https://github.com/andrewhwanpark/dark-poole).
It's hosted using [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## `api.vexcodes.com`

A small API hosted on Cloudflare Workers which hosts the latest versions of my cogs at [/v1/vers](https://api.vexcodes.com/v1/vers)

## `cogdocs.vexcodes.com`

The documentation for my cogs, build by [RTD](https://readthedocs.org/).

## `go.vexcodes.com`

A URL redirection subdomain with a few redirects. This is also powered by Cloudflare Workers.

## `s.vexcodes.com`

Deprecated subdomain which is identical to `go.vexcodes.com`.

## `img.vexcodes.com`

Also a URL redirection subdomain, but powered by [Kutt](https://kutt.it/) and leading to a Scaleway storage bucket.
