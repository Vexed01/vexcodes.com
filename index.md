# Hello!

My main project are my [cogs](https://go.vexcodes.com/gh/cogs)
for a self-hosted Discord bot called [Red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot).

I also have a [small blog](/blog).

There's more about what this domain has on the [about page]](/about).

If you're looking for my cog docs, they're at [cogdocs.vexcodes.com](https://cogdocs.vexcodes.com).
